# blobs game

This repository contains the source code of the browser game "blobs"<br/>
**Note:** This game is still in development. It may not work yet. <br />
> There is currently a rewrite going on. The code that is running on production can be found under the master branch. Any pull requests depending on that branch will be ignored.<br/>

### Selfhosting notes
If you plan on hosting this on your own, you will need to compile the source code using the Go compiler. The frontend part of the game is written in TypeScript, so you will also need to install TypeScript to transpile it. <br/>
For convenience, we've written a Makefile which you can use to compile everything that's required.
```shell script
$ make all
```

### What is this?
__A:__ Blobs is a work-in-progress multiplayer game that involves blob characters (you may know these from Android) that “nom” players in order to gain blob rating, which shows how skilled you are at the game.

### Where can I play this game?
__A:__ As stated above, this game is still a WIP and may not work yet. Its interface (login, registration and main menu) does exist and can be accessed through the internet by anybody and all other pages should work well, means that you can register and login without any problems. The game should work fine, too, but there is not much yet.

### Any ETA when this game is ready?
__A:__ The game is playable, but it's lacking features. We are working on it to get it done as soon as possible. We do not know when this game is ready, but you can expect the first version to be ready in 2019.

### Can I donate for this project?
__A:__ No, there is no way to donate for now. Thank you for caring.
